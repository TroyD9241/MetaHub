# **MetaHub**
-----

## Mission

**The goal of MetaHub is to create an inclusive `Hub` for all members of the Web3 Community.**

>We truly believe in this space and want to help The [Metaverse](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/08/10/what-is-the-metaverse/) live up to its potential. Creating a place that rewards both developers and non-developers for contributing towards making the Metaverse live up to its potential.

## What is MetaHub?

> MetaHub is an application that allows developers, entrepreneurs, companies, opensource advocates, and of course the common crypto carrier to freely exchange ideas with each other.

> Community members can make suggestions about things that are currently missing inside the space, improvments that could be made, general frustrations, and everything inbetween.

> MetaHub will always be opensource and we will always be welcoming of everyone who wants to make the Metaverse a better place.

### Why is this a big deal? Aren't there other sites like this?
> To this day we haven't seen anything like it.

> We plan to implement a coin that is earned by contributing to the community. You earn assets for being here and contributing.
